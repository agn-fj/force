export.go - better way to init structs?
 - new? http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#allocation_new
 - read in json file of types?

Adding support for the following 4 non-wildcard types that the CLI currently exports:
Dashboard
Document
EmailTemplate
Report

(Details on * vs. non-*: http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_meta/Content/meta_types_list.htm)
 
Good:
 - Works!
 - People who were once mad about missing EmailTemplates can be happier
 - The CLI may offer increased value for users looking to back up their org's metadata more fully

Less Good:
- Hardcoding the folder names into a new function (GetFolderTypeName) in export.go didn't feel great  
- Neither does calling the api repeatedly - once for each folder
